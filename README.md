Predicting 30-Day ICU Readmissions Using the MIMIC-III Database: Development and Comparison of Machine Learning Models

The object of this project is to extend the scope of the LACE index to predictors available early in the admission while maximizing the performance of the extended predictive models with our local data. Specifically, this project will use the MIMIC-III database to train machine learning models for predicting whether a patient discharged from an intensive care unit (ICU) is likely to be readmitted within 30 days. After selecting our features of interest, parameter tuning and cross-validation will be conducted to evaluate and compare each modelâ€™s predictive capability.

The PLACES Index
P: Patient
L: Lengh of hospital/ICU stay
A: Acuity of admission: emergent & urgent vs planned
C: Comorbidity: 30 categories
E: Emergency room utilization
S: Severity Score: oasis
